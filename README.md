# Amazon Review Big Data Analysis

* Data Transformation and Storage: Utilized Hive for initial data ingestion and transformation of over 200,000 Amazon reviews. The data was subsequently stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), allowing for efficient data handling and scalability.

* Big Data Analysis with BigQuery: Leveraged Google Cloud's BigQuery for in-depth analysis and insight extraction from the large dataset. This enabled quick retrieval and visualization of data, facilitating more informed decision-making processes.

* Sentiment Analysis with Spark NLP: Employed Spark NLP's pretrained model (sentimentdl_use_twitter) to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews, categorizing them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This analysis helped in understanding customer sentiments and preferences.

* Recommendation System Using ALS Algorithm: Developed a personalized product recommendation system using Apache Spark's Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. This system suggests products to users based on their historical preferences and behaviors, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

* Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering: Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups. This strategic segmentation supports tailored marketing initiatives by targeting specific customer groups based on their purchasing behaviors and preferences.
